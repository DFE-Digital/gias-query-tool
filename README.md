# The [Unofficial] GIAS Query Toolkit

Ever wanted quickly query the [Get Information About
Schools](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) dataset but couldn't
because it's provided in an unwieldy CSV file that's not properly-encoded and
has too many columns?

Great, you're in the right place!

This set of tools downloads and imports the data into a locally-running PostgreSQL
database and lets you take advantage of [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) to supercharge
your queries.

## Getting up and running

### Prerequisites

* [**GNU Make**](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), used to run the automatic download and import
* [**GNU Iconv**](https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/), fix file encoding
* [**GNU Wget**](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) for downloading the GIAS CSV file
* [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) with an local superuser account
* [**PostGIS**](https://postgis.net/) for geographic query goodness

### Running the command

To download, cleanse, import and build the data objects only a single command
should be required.

```bash
make
```

When debugging, use `make refresh` to run the import steps without repeatedly downloading
the export file.

```bash
make refresh
```

## Manual importing

The entire import, apart from file cleansing, is written in standard SQL. Executing
the statements needs to be done in the correct order, the `Makefile` is the best
place to get a feel for how it works.

## Sending this data to BigQuery

Dependencies

```
pip install bigquery-schema-generator
brew install gcloud-cli
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
```

The script assumes you have a `gias` dataset in your BigQuery project and a
Google Cloud Storage bucket called `rugged-abacus-uploads`.

### Uploading

First build the tables in your local database

```bash
make
```

Then run the import

```bash
make load_to_bq
```

## Tables and views

The importer creates the following database objects:

| Name                         | Type                | Description                                                        |
| ----                         | ----                | -----------                                                        |
| `schools`                    | `table`             | All schools, both open and closed                                  |
| `deprivation_pupil_premium`  | `table`             | [DPP information](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pupil-premium-effective-use-and-accountability) broken down by school |
| `open_schools`               | `materialized view` | Only open schools                                                  |
| `regions`                    | `table`             | England's regions and associated gegoraphic information            |
| `local_authorities`          | `table`             | England's local authorities and associated gegoraphic information  |
| `establishment`              | `type`              | School types (eg. Foundation school, Free school)                  |
| `establishment_group`        | `type`              | School categories (eg. Independent Schools, Universities, Colleges |
| `gender`                     | `type`              | School gender policies (eg. Boys, Girls, Mixed)                    |
| `ofsted_rating`              | `type`              | All Ofsted ratings, including deprecated ones                      |
| `phase`                      | `type`              | School phases (eg. Secondary, Primary, 16 plus)                    |
| `rural_urban_classification` | `type`              | Classification of a school's setting, source links in definition   |

## FAQs

### Why use [enumerated types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-enum.html) when you could've just used a `varchar`?

Efficiency aside, the main reason is to allow [ordering by _rank_ rather than
alphabetic position](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-enum.html#id-1.5.7.15.6).

### I want to query a column that's not included in the import, how do I add it?

1. Add your desired column to the `create` statement in `ddl/tables/create_schools.sql`. Ensure
   it is the correct datatype.
2. Then add your new column name to the list of target columns in `dml/import_schools.sql` and
   add a the corresponding column in the source data (i.e. the source CSV) to the `select` part
   of the statement. For datatypes other than `varchar`, cast appropriately with `::new_datatype`
   There are plenty of examples of casting in the file already
3. See if it worked, run `make refresh` to drop everything and re-import

### Where can I find and how do I import other geographic data?

There are plenty of great sources for educational geographic data:

* [Open Geography Portal](http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/)
* [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/geographicalproducts/)
* [UK Data Service](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/get-data/themes/education.aspx)
* [National Records of Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/geography/our-products/census-datasets)

Once you've found a useful dataset, select the [Shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) download option
if available. Now we can use `shp2pgsql` to import it. It comes with a GUI which makes the process very simple.

![shp2pgsql spatial data loader](docs/images/shp2pgsql.png)

Alternatively, and more-flexibly (if the dataset you want isn't available as a
Shapefile), you can use [GDAL](https://gdal.org/)'s
[ogr2ogr](https://gdal.org/programs/ogr2ogr.html).
